# Traffic-Density-Analyser


In this project we focus on analysing the traffic density using computer vision concepts and cnn model. We work on taking a photo or video as input and give a feedback whether the road traffic is high or low.
This operation was done using pretrained model , i.e. Yolov8 for vehicle detection.
